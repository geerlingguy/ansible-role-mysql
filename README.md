# Ansible Role: MySQL

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mysql/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Installs and configures MySQL or MariaDB server on RHEL/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu servers.

## Requirements

No special requirements; note that this role requires root access, so either run it in a playbook with a global `become: true`, or invoke the role in your playbook like:

```yaml
- hosts: database
  roles:
    - role: geerlingguy.mysql
      become: true
```

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

```yaml
mysql_user_home: /root
mysql_user_name: root
mysql_user_password: root
```

The home directory inside which Python MySQL settings will be stored, which Ansible will use when connecting to MySQL. This should be the home directory of the user which runs this Ansible role. The `mysql_user_name` and `mysql_user_password` can be set if you are running this role under a non-root user account and want to set a non-root user.

```yaml
mysql_root_home: /root
mysql_root_username: root
mysql_root_password: root
```

The MySQL root user account details.

```yaml
mysql_root_password_update: false
```

Whether to force update the MySQL root user's password. By default, this role will only change the root user's password when MySQL is first configured. You can force an update by setting this to `true`.

> Note: If you get an error like `ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)` after a failed or interrupted playbook run, this usually means the root password wasn't originally updated to begin with. Try either removing  the `.my.cnf` file inside the configured `mysql_user_home` or updating it and setting `password=''` (the insecure default password). Run the playbook again, with `mysql_root_password_update` set to `yes`, and the setup should complete.

> Note: If you get an error like `ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)` when trying to log in from the CLI you might need to run as root or sudoer.

```yaml
mysql_enabled_on_startup: true
```

Whether MySQL should be enabled on startup.

```yaml
mysql_config_file: *default value depends on OS*
mysql_config_include_dir: *default value depends on OS*
```

The main my.cnf configuration file and include directory.

```yaml
overwrite_global_mycnf: true
```

Whether the global my.cnf should be overwritten each time this role is run. Setting this to `false` tells Ansible to only create the `my.cnf` file if it doesn't exist. This should be left at its default value (`true`) if you'd like to use this role's variables to configure MySQL.

```yaml
mysql_config_include_files: []
```

A list of files that should override the default global my.cnf. Each item in the array requires a "src" parameter which is a path to a file. An optional "force" parameter can force the file to be updated each time ansible runs.

```yaml
mysql_databases: []
```

The MySQL databases to create. A database has the values `name`, `encoding` (defaults to `utf8`), `collation` (defaults to `utf8_general_ci`) and `replicate` (defaults to `1`, only used if replication is configured). The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_db` module.

You can also delete a database (or ensure it's not on the server) by setting `state` to `absent` (defaults to `present`).

```yaml
mysql_users: []
```

The MySQL users and their privileges. A user has the values:

  - `name`
  - `host` (defaults to `localhost`)
  - `password` (can be plaintext or encryptedâ€”if encrypted, set `encrypted: true`)
  - `encrypted` (defaults to `false`)
  - `priv` (defaults to `*.*:USAGE`)
  - `append_privs` (defaults to `false`)
  - `state`  (defaults to `present`)
  - `case_sensitive` (defaults to `false`)
  - `update_password` (defaults to `always`)

The formats of these are the same as in the `mysql_user` module.

```yaml
mysql_packages:
  - mysql
  - mysql-server
```

(OS-specific, RedHat/CentOS defaults listed here) Packages to be installed. In some situations, you may need to add additional packages, like `mysql-devel`.

```yaml
mysql_enablerepo: ""
```

(RedHat/CentOS only) If you have enabled any additional repositories (might I suggest geerlingguy.repo-epel or geerlingguy.repo-remi), those repositories can be listed under this variable (e.g. `remi,epel`). This can be handy, as an example, if you want to install later versions of MySQL.

```yaml
mysql_python_package_debian: python3-mysqldb
```

(Ubuntu/Debian only) If you need to explicitly override the MySQL Python package, you can set it here. Set this to `python-mysqldb` if using older distributions running Python 2.

```yaml
mysql_port: "3306"
mysql_bind_address: '0.0.0.0'
mysql_datadir: /var/lib/mysql
mysql_socket: *default value depends on OS*
mysql_pid_file: *default value depends on OS*
```

Default MySQL connection configuration.

```yaml
mysql_log_file_group: mysql *adm on Debian*
mysql_log: ""
mysql_log_error: *default value depends on OS*
mysql_syslog_tag: *default value depends on OS*
```yaml

MySQL logging configuration. Setting `mysql_log` (the general query log) or `mysql_log_error` to `syslog` will make MySQL log to syslog using the `mysql_syslog_tag`.

```yaml
mysql_slow_query_log_enabled: false
mysql_slow_query_log_file: *default value depends on OS*
mysql_slow_query_time: 2
```

Slow query log settings. Note that the log file will be created by this role, but if you're running on a server with SELinux or AppArmor, you may need to add this path to the allowed paths for MySQL, or disable the mysql profile. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, you can run `sudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld /etc/apparmor.d/disable/usr.sbin.mysqld && sudo service apparmor restart`.

```yaml
mysql_key_buffer_size: "256M"
mysql_max_allowed_packet: "64M"
mysql_table_open_cache: "256"
...
```

The rest of the settings in `defaults/main.yml` control MySQL's memory usage and some other common settings. The default values are tuned for a server where MySQL can consume 512 MB RAM, so you should consider adjusting them to suit your particular server better.

```yaml
mysql_disable_log_bin: false
```

This variable should be set to `true` if you don't need replication, or otherwise don't need a log of all MySQL's activity. If you leave it at the default value, disk space may be consumed at an alarming rate on highly-utlilized database servers!

```yaml
mysql_server_id: "1"
mysql_max_binlog_size: "100M"
mysql_binlog_format: "ROW"
mysql_expire_logs_days: "10"
mysql_replication_role: ''
mysql_replication_master: ''
mysql_replication_user: {}
```

Replication settings. Set `mysql_server_id` and `mysql_replication_role` by server (e.g. the master would be ID `1`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `master`, and the slave would be ID `2`, with the `mysql_replication_role` of `slave`). The `mysql_replication_user` uses the same keys as individual list items in `mysql_users`, and is created on master servers, and used to replicate on all the slaves.

`mysql_replication_master` needs to resolve to an IP or a hostname which is accessable to the Slaves (this could be a `/etc/hosts` injection or some other means), otherwise the slaves cannot communicate to the master.

If the replication master has different IP addresses where you are running ansible and where the mysql replica is running, you can *optionally* specify a `mysql_replication_master_inventory_host` to access the machine (e.g. you run ansible on your local machine, but the mysql master and replica need to communicate on a different network)

```yaml
mysql_hide_passwords: false
```

Do you need to hide tasks' output which contain passwords during the execution ?

### MariaDB usage

This role works with either MySQL or a compatible version of MariaDB. On RHEL/CentOS 7+, the mariadb database engine was substituted as the default MySQL replacement package. No modifications are necessary though all of the variables still reference 'mysql' instead of mariadb.

#### Ubuntu 14.04+ MariaDB configuration

On Ubuntu, the package names are named differently, so the `mysql_package` variable needs to be altered. Set the following variables (at a minimum):

    mysql_packages:
      - mariadb-client
      - mariadb-server
    mysql_daemon: mariadb

## Dependencies

If you have `ansible` installed (e.g. `pip3 install ansible`), none.

If you have only installed `ansible-core`, be sure to require `community.mysql` in your `collections/requirements.yml` or install it manually with `ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql`.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: db-servers
      become: true
      vars_files:
        - vars/main.yml
      roles:
        - { role: geerlingguy.mysql }

*Inside `vars/main.yml`*:

    mysql_root_password: super-secure-password
    mysql_databases:
      - name: example_db
        encoding: latin1
        collation: latin1_general_ci
    mysql_users:
      - name: example_user
        host: "%"
        password: similarly-secure-password
        priv: "example_db.*:ALL"
